Files for my custom Firefox New Tab webpage.

## Using this for your new tab page
If you want to use this for your own Firefox new tab page, No Text To Speech has made a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hb0p-TxgZzs) that you can watch.<br>
All HTML files use CSS/JS files from this repository.<br>
You may fork this repo, but make sure you change CSS links, etc. etc..
